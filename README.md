# Îž Datalayer Grafana Dashboards

This repository contains the dashboard definitions for the Datalayer Observer service. Read more on [Datalayer Tech](https://datalayer.tech/docs/build/kubernetes/services/system/observer). We are using the following tools to create the dashboards:

- `OpenTelemetry Collector`:
    - As deployment to proxy metrics and traces from Datalayer services to Prometheus and Tempo.
    - As daemonset to parse pod log files and send them to Loki.
- `Prometheus`: To gather metrics.
- `Tempo`: To gather traces.
- `Loki`: To gather logs.
- `AlertManager`: To manage alerts.
- `Grafana`: To visualize and analyze the telemetry.
